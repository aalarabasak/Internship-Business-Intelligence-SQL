# Internship – Business Intelligence (SQL)

This repository contains SQL scripts created during my internship to support multiple Business Intelligence dashboards.

## What’s inside
- **Dashboard SQL scripts:** queries for KPI calculations, aggregations, joins, and reporting-ready outputs.
- **Data validation / consistency checks:** scripts used to verify metric logic and data quality.
- **Dummy dataset generation:** some scripts create **dummy/sample datasets** so dashboards can be built and tested without relying on sensitive/production data.
